Release-Notes for 1.0.1 (Mo Nov 13 22:56:00 CET 2006):
Some small fixes. Nothing major. Not everything is up to par but I think
that that bug I'm (slowly) fixing is rare enough that people won't notice
and I think it's better to get it out the door, it's been lying on my hdd
for ages...

Release-Notes for 1.0.0 (So  2 Apr 18:49:46 CEST 2006):
This is it! Vobcopy is "ready" in the sense that it can be in maintainance
mode from now on. I'm working on vobcopy2 (sort of) and that will be
massively re-written. So, until then, enjoy this one here!

Release-Notes for 0.9.0-pre1 (Fr Feb 24 21:15:36 CET 2006):
Backup Release


Release-Notes for 0.5.16 (Wed Dec  7 23:32:50 CET 2005):
Rather minor stuff: -m and -n are mutually exclusive -now they are also in
the code. The size-checking code in the -m part was broken and is hopefully
fixed now. And a typo in the man-page.

Release-Notes for 0.5.15 (Fr Jul 29 04:00:01 CEST 2005):
By a patch from Guy Naor there is now the option to skip already copied
files (from a previous run). Strange dvd's with files ending in ";?" should
now also work.

Release-Notes for 0.5.14 (Thu Nov 18 06:08:53 CET 2004):

There have been some small cleanups that clear up a little what is being 
named what and such... also another small code-path for freebsd

Release-Notes for 0.5.14-rc1 (Son Okt 24 04:00:41 CEST 2004):

Takeshi Nakamura provided quite some patches to get parts of vobcopy to work
better with openbsd, freebsd and solaris. From him I also learned about
netbsd patches from the netbsd folks I incorporated. I dunno what else,
sorry, forgot...
