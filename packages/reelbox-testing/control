Description: testing software tree for the reelbox
 This package will make shure that the newest, latest and mostly "untested"
 software fresh from the developers will be installed onto the ReelBox.
 .
 If you are a developer or tester or you always want the latest but greatest
 pieces of software and do not care to deal with untestet software this is
 most probably want you want.
 .
 Do not install this package on a production box as this may destroy your 
 timers, recordings, marriage or even does not work at all.
