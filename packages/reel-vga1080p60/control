Description: VGA resolution @ 1080p60 for the ReelBox Avantgarde
 This package is a modified version of 915resolution.
 It sets the resolution of the VGA (and maybe DVI) output for KDE 
 to 1080p60 for use with a standard TV display.
 .
 Original description of 915resolution:
 915resolution is a tool to modify the video BIOS of the 800
 and 900 series Intel graphics chipsets. This includes the 845G,
 855G, and 865G chipsets, as well as 915G, 915GM, and 945G chipsets.
 This modification is necessary to allow the display of certain
 graphics resolutions for an Xorg or XFree86 graphics server.
 .
 915resolution's modifications of the BIOS are transient.
 There is no risk of permanent modification of the BIOS.
 This also means that 915resolution must be run every time the
 computer boots in order for its changes to take effect.
 If you want to automatically set the resolution on each boot
 and before X is launched, see /usr/share/doc/915resolution/README.Debian
 for information about configuring the provided initscript.
 .
 The 915resolution package becomes obsolete with the newer xorg,
 especially if you have the xserver-xorg-video-intel package installed.
 Newer xorg brings modesetting support by default.
