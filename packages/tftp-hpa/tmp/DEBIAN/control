Description: IPv4 Trivial File Transfer Protocol server + client
 This is tftp-hpa, a conglomerate of a number of versions of the BSD                                              
 TFTP code, changed around to port to a whole collection of operating                                             
 systems.  The goal is to work on any reasonably modern Unix with                                                 
 sockets.

 The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is normally used only for
 booting diskless workstations.  The tftp package provides the user
 interface and the server for TFTP, which allows users to transfer files
 to and from a remote machine.
