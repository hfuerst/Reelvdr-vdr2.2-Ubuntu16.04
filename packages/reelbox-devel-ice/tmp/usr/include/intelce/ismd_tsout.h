/** @weakgroup ismd_tsout Transport Stream Output
The Transport Stream Output (TSOut) is a timed hardware interface used to transmit a MPEG-2 transport stream.

The Transport Stream Output (tsout) module allows isochronous transmission of
MPEG2 transport streams via physical transport stream interfaces.

\b Operation

The data to be transmitted may be supplied as a standard, MPEG2 transport stream (TS)
containing 188-byte packets or as a timed transport stream (TTS) consisting of 192-byte
packets containing 32-bit timestamp headers.

For timed transport streams containing timestamp headers, each packet is transmitted
when its timestamp matches an internal transmission counter. The internal
transmission counters value is set when the \ref ismd_tsout_set_basetime API is called
to set the basetime for the TSOut module.

For standard streams not containing timestamp headers, packets containing PCR
values will be transmitted at the relative times indicated by the PCRs, with
non-PCR packets being approximately evenly spaced between PCR packets.

The clock to drive the internal transmission counter must be provided using \ref ismd_tsout_set_clock.

 * TSOut characteristics (signal polarity, Transmission rate, etc) are set using platform_config

The following is the typical programming sequence to use tsout:
-# Request access to a specific transport stream interface, using \ref ismd_tsout_open. The stream
type (TS or TTS) is specified at this time.
-# Get a handle to the input port for the newly opened TSOut instance. This handle is used to \ref ismd_port_connect
the TSOut module to other SMD modules to source data to the TSOut interface.
-# Set the clock to be used for controlling transmission timing using \ref
ismd_tsout_set_clock. If the stream to be transmitted is currently being received
via a "push mode", the clock used for TSOut should be the clock recovered from this stream.
-# For TS streams where PCRs need to be used to determine packet transmission times, the PID carrying the
PCRs needs to be set. This is done by calling the \ref ismd_tsout_ts_set_pcr_pid API.
-# Optionally, if required, \ref ismd_tsout_register_event API can be used to register for various interesting events (e.g. End of Stream)
-# Set the basetime for the TSOut module to the same basetime used by the other modules in the pipeline using the \ref ismd_tsout_set_basetime API
-# Place the tsout instance in the "playing" state using \ref ismd_dev_set_state.
-# Begin writing stream data into the input port of the tsout instance.
-# When transmission is complete, close the tsout instance using \ref ismd_dev_close.

This programming sequence is available for reference in the form of 
sample player application ../smd_sample_apps/tsout_streamer/tsout_streamer.c.
