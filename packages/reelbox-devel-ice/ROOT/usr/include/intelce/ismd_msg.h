@defgroup AUTO_API Auto API

Autoapi is a set of scripts and source templates for making an API "location independent".  What this means is code can be written to a local, standard C API, and the real implementation of the API can be located in a completely different address space or even a different device.  It can be in a shared library, in a kernel driver, even across the network.  And which version an app uses can be changed simply by swapping a shared library.

/* Defines which control the auto api script.  Only functions marked with these
 * defines will be exported by Auto API. 
 * xTRUSTEDx defines are for API access control.
 *   SMDTRUSTED has a similar meaning to SMDEXPORT but allow AutoAPI to include special 
 *   security checking when the functions are called.
 *   x_GLOBALOBJECT defines are for API access control to global object.

@brief add a connection release callback

Adds a new callback function that will be called if the connection dies (e.g. the app exits).  Allows resources to be released gracefully if the app dies or does not clean up properly.

@param [in] connection ID number for the connection to bind the callback to.
@param [in] callback Function to call if the connection ends.
@param [in] data Pointer to pass to the callback function.
@retval 0 Registration was successful.
@retval ISMD_ERROR_NO_RESOURCES Out of memory.  Unable to complete registration
@retval ISMD_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER Invalid parameter.  Callback is NULL or connection value is invalid.

/**
@brief remove a connection release callback

Remove the callback and data from the connection manager.  On success, the
callback request is removed and not called. An error means the callback has already been called and removed.

WARNING! ismd_connection_unregister must NOT be called from the callback function
registered with ismd_connect_register(). Doing so will result in a deadlock.
@param [in] callback Callback function pointer passed in to ismd_connect_register().
@param [in] data The data matching the callback to be removed
@retval 0 Callback was removed successfully
@retval ISMD_ERROR_OBJECT_DELETED Callback not found: already called and removed.
