+Description: the xine video player library, development packages
+ This contains development files (headers, documentation and the like)
+ for the xine library (libxine).
+ .
+ Libxine provides the complete infrastructure for a video/media player. It
+ supports MPEG 1/2 and some AVI and Quicktime videos out of the box, so you
+ can use it to play DVDs, (S)VCDs and most video files out there. It
+ supports network streams, subtitles and even MP3 or Ogg files. It's
+ extensible to your heart's content via plugins for audio and video output,
+ input media, demuxers (stream types), audio/video and subtitle codecs.

+The CSS plugin story...
+=======================
+
+xine does support playing unencrypted and encrypted dvd using the library 
+libdvdread/libdvdcss. Due to legal reasons, it is not possible for debian
+nor derivatives to ship a libdvdcss, which would be needed to play encrypted
+dvds.
+
+For more information how to install the necessary plugin, please read
+/usr/share/doc/libdvdread3/README.Debian
+
+
+The Default audio plugin story... (#354437, et al)
+==================================================
+
+The default audio plugin, unless set otherwise by the user, is 'auto', and not
+e.g. 'arts'.  The reasoning behind this is: If artsd is not running, xine-lib
+will fall back to the next audio driver (should be esd, which also fails if esd
+is not running), so it finally falls back to ALSA (or even OSS).  This is the
+only way to automatically use an audio driver that will work with every
+conceivable setup. (Systems that run a sound daemon usually do so because
+otherwise they would only have one sound channel. So in those cases the daemon
+should be used, unless explicitly configured otherwise.)
+
+So, if you are experiencing instant crashes with the error message 
+'can't create mcop directory', please start xine (xine-ui or gxine) with parameter 
+"-A auto"

-
-    Playback of various stream types
-
-        DVD Playback with xine

-        How can I watch files with external AVI subtitles?
-
-    Running xine
-
-        I have a lot of dropped frames - what can I do?
-        Oki, xine doesn't drop frames now but video output still is not really
-            smooth!
-        I have problems when using xine on FreeBSD, Solaris, ... !
-        What is aalib? How do I use it in xine?
-        Does xine support my dxr3 / hollywood+ card?
-
-    Audio related questions
-
-        What audio drivers does xine support? OSS? Alsa? Arts? Esd?
-        When I'm watching a movie, the sound effects are much higher in volume
-            than the voices!
-        When I play this stream, xine shows video but there's no audio!
-        Can xine produce 4-/5-channel surround audio output?
-        What about ac3 output via spdif to an external ac3 decoder?
-        Getting SPDIF output from a SBLive 5.1 using OSS drivers
-        Changing the volume with the GUI control has no effect! What's up!?
-        Audio is stuttering and i see a lot of "metronom: fixing sound card
-            drift by -2115 pts" on the console output
-        xine seems to lose sound arbitrarily during playback, especially with
-            DVDs
-
-    Video related questions
-
-        I can hear the audio - but I don't see a picture!
-        I only see a blue (or green or black) video image most of the time.
-        The image looks strange, it is shifted, cropped or shows weird lines!
-        How can I make xine use the Xv extension and what drivers do I need?
-        Some parts of my X Desktop get transparent when xine plays the video!
-        The aspect ratio of the video is wrong!
-        What is the difference between discarded and skipped frames?
-        My xine is runing in black and white! / I only get a grey video output!
-        Which is the best video driver to use?
-
-    OSD and overlay related questions
-
-        What is this "unscaled" OSD about?
-        I can't see the OSD or it leaves a black box over the image!
-        Why colours of overlays/subtitles seem to be "leaking"?
-        Why external subtitles look so ugly?
-        Why subtitles can't be displayed outside the video?
-        What kinds of subtitle fonts does xine use?
-        How to create own xine subtitle fonts?
-        Encoding of external subtitles is bad. What is wrong?
-
-    Error Messages: What they mean and what you can do
-
-        Starting xine crashes X, I am logged out of my desktop!

-General questions about xine and this document
-
-What is the xine engine?
-
-The xine engine is a free media player engine. It comes in the form of a shared
-libarary and is typically used by media player frontends and other multimedia
-applications for playback of multimedia streams such as movies, radio/tv
-network streams, DVDs, VCDs.
-
-Since there are several frontends for the xine library available, this document
-has a problem when it comes to examples. The two most common frontends xine-ui
-and gxine are mixed in command line examples throughout this FAQ. When you use
-a different frontend, some of these will not work for you. The filename of the
-config file also varies amongst frontends. If you get confused, I recommend you
-try with one of xine-ui or gxine.

-
-My question is not yet covered here - where can I ask for help?
-
-First of all be sure that your question is really not covered here and that you
-haven't just been a bit too lazy to read through all of this text. ;-). Also
-check out the documentation specific to the frontend (e.g. xine-ui or gxine or
-totem).
-
-That said - you are welcome to mail to our user mailing list: <
-xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net> Please provide some info about your setup so
-people have a chance to help you, e.g. include information about your audio/
-video hardware and drivers you use, operating system, cpu type and some console
-output/any error messages. Also include command line parameters you have
-specified and information about the type of stream you're trying to play back.
-Also very important is the version of xine you're using and information about
-any additional plugins you may have installed on your system.

-
-What are those xine-lib, xine-ui, gnome-xine, ... modules in cvs for?
-
-Some time ago xine just became too complex to be just one big program.
-Therefore it was split into two major parts.
-
-xine-lib is simply speaking the engine of xine. It contains all basic plugins
-and is necessary to run anything that relies on xine. (This is the part that is
-covered in this FAQ.)
-
-Then there are frontends - applications that use xine. The most common frontend
-is that of a media player. There are currently two frontends being developed in
-the xine project, xine-ui (skinned dvd-player style frontend directly based on
-xlib) and gxine, a desktop media-player style frontend using the standard gtk
-widget set and comes with a mozilla browser plugin. External projects like
-kaffeine, sinek and totem develop additional frontends. In the future you will
-likely see more and different types of applications being developed which will
-use the xine engine for video processing and other multimedia purposes.
-
-If you simply want a media/dvd player, you'll need to install xine-lib first
-and then choose and install a player frontend like xine-ui or gxine.
-
-Other modules in CVS are: xine-plugin a mozilla browser plugin for streaming
-media playback using xine, xine_www the xine project website sources.

-Checking out xine modules from Mercurial
-
-The repositories are listed at http://hg.debian.org/hg/; however, this is a
-list of all repositories which are kept there, not just the xine project's
-(which are the ones which begin with xine-lib/). To check one out:
-
-   hg clone http://hg.debian.org/hg/repository local_copy
-
-e.g.
-
-   hg clone http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib xine-lib

-To check out xine modules from CVS, first do this:
-
-   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@xine.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine login
-
-The password is empty, just press Enter.
-
-Then, to check out individual modules (e.g. xine-lib or xine-ui):
-
-   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@xine.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/xine co <modulename>
-
-If you want xine-lib or gxine, you should use Mercurial instead. The CVS

-
-How do I submit patches?
-
-First, make sure that you're using a current development version (see above) or
-at least the current release version. Then, once you're ready to send the
-patch...
-
-Generate your patch using either cvs diff -u > my.patch or hg diff > my.patch
-(as appropriate). Make sure that your message subject briefly describes the
-patch; your message body should contain a longer description of the patch. Your
-patch should be applicable using patch -p0 -i my.patch or, preferably, patch
--p1 -i my.patch from the top-level directory in the source tree (i.e. where
-configure.ac is) - this is fairly important for our Mercurial-based
-repositories since it makes importing your patch that much easier (hg import
-defaults to -p1).
-
-Alternatively, if you've been hacking away at a module which is maintained
-using mercurial, you can make them available as diffs - use hg export or, if
-you have several patches, you could use hg bundle instead (both require extra
-parameters; hg help export and hg help bundle for more details) - or via HTTP
-by using hg serve. In the latter case, you'll need to post a URL from which a
-developer can pull the changes.
-
-Patches should normally be sent to the xine-devel mailing list, <
-xine-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>.

-
-Where can I find pre-compiled binaries, e.g. RPMs?
-
-The xine project does not provide pre-compiled binaries for legal reasons (some
-parts of xine may be covered by patents in some countries). Some OS projects/
-vendors (e.g. debian, freebsd, ...) offer binaries for their distributions -
-please contact them or use their package search tools for further info. You can

-
-Building and installing xine from source
-
-What do I need to compile everything properly?
-
-First of all an official and stable release of gcc. Also be aware that patched
-gcc versions may break parts of xine and are therefore not supported by the
-xine project.
-
-Furthermore you'll have to use GNU make to compile xine. On most GNU/Linux
-systems "make" is GNU make - on other platforms use "gmake" instead. Also, zlib
-is required (including the appropriate header files, which are often found in a
-package called zlib-devel or similar.)
-
-If you want to compile xine from CVS, you'll need to have the autobuild tools
-installed (automake, autoconf and libtool - in recent versions).
-
-Frontends might need additional libraries, e.g. for gxine you'll need to have
-GTK2 installed. Make sure you have not only the shared libraries themselves but
-also the header files (often packaged seperately as so-called -dev packages) on
-your system.
-
-Some plugins that come with the xine engine need additional libraries
-(otherwise they will not be built). For example, libogg and libvorbis (plus
-their include files) are needed for ogg/vorbis support. Most notably, if you
-want to see any video on your X11 desktop (and that's what you're here for,
-isn't it?), you need the X developer packages as well.
-
-Don't worry about this too much right now, xine's configure (see below) will
-check for all the stuff needed and will tell you what's missing (which means
-that you should check the output it produces carefully ;) ).

-How do I compile xine?
-
-Simple build instructions for beginners
-
-Download the latest xine-lib and gxine/xine-ui tarballs, then follow these
-instruction. To unpack a tarball, use:
-
-   tar xfvz tarballname.tar.gz
-
-The following instructions will install xine in /usr/local where it will be
-visible for all users. You need root privileges to do this on most systems.
-
-After unpacking xine-lib, issue:
-
-   ./configure
-   make install
-
-Make sure your /etc/ld.so.conf contains /usr/local/lib and continue with:
-
-   ldconfig
-
-Now unpack your frontend (gxine or xine-ui or ...), then:
-
-   ./configure
-   make install
-

-
-Complete build instructions
-
-The build process is the same for all of the xine modules.
-
-You have to start with xine-lib. If built and installed successfully, you can
-continue with the frontend(s).
-
-If you have installed xine-lib to a non-standard prefix, make sure that you
-have $prefix/bin in your PATH and that your linker finds libs in $prefix/lib -
-otherwise trying to build modules that rely on xine-lib will fail with
-configure complaining about not finding certain parts of libxine. Using bash
-you can do something like:
-
-   export PATH="$prefix/bin:$PATH"
-   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$prefix/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
-
-to make sure libxine can be found by the frontend(s).
-
-Last but not least. Here the build instructions. As stated earlier, those are
-the same for every xine module.
-
-   ./autogen.sh [-> *only* if you checked your sources out of CVS]
-   ./configure
-   make
-   make install

-Making your own RPM packages (xine-lib, xine-ui, gxine)
-
-Basically you will only have to issue one command, if you have just downloaded
-a source tarball from our web site:
-
-   rpmbuild -ta <THE_NAME_OF_YOUR_SOURCE_TAR_BALL>
-
-(Older versions of RPM use rpm instead of rpmbuild.)
-
-This will start the binary and source RPM building. After compiling is
-finished, a binary rpm is placed in your rpm binary directory which is
-something like /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/<YOUR_ARCHITECTURE> and a source RPM is
-written to your rpm source dir (e.g. /usr/src/RPM/SRPMS).
-
-In case that you have a fresh CVS checkout, you will need to do the following
-first in order to get a tarball release out of it which you can later use with
-the rpmbuild -ta command above:
-
-   ./autogen.sh && make clean && make dist
-
-In any case, please keep in mind that you have to build and install xine-lib
-first before you can proceed with xine-ui.

-
-Making your own .deb packages (xine-lib, xine-ui, gxine)
-
-You'll need a CVS or HG snapshot tarball or source checked out from the
-repository.
-
-First, make sure that the "devscripts" package is installed. You'll then need
-the following commands (the first one isn't needed unless you're using a
-snapshot tarball):
-
-   tar xzf <PACKAGE-VER.tar.gz>
-   cd <PACKAGE-VER>
-   ./autogen.sh noconfig
-   debuild binary
-
-
-(If debuild complains about unmet dependencies, then install them using
-aptitude install <PACKAGES> (as root) then re-run debuild binary.
-
-Once the build has been successfully completed, you'll have some new .debs.
-
-   cd ..
-   ls *.deb
-   su - -c 'cd '"`pwd`"' && dpkg -i <DEB_PACKAGES>'
-
-
-Ubuntu users will probably want to use this instead of that su:
-
-   sudo dpkg -i <DEB_PACKAGES>
-
-
-In any case, please keep in mind that you have to build and install xine-lib
-first before you can proceed with xine-ui or gxine.

-
-Can I provide additional CFLAGS for compilation?
-
-Yes, you can do so by setting the CFLAGS variable and then running configure
-again. You can even pass them to configure directly. Example:
-
-   ./configure CFLAGS="-march=i686"
-
-Other user variables configure respects are:
-
-  â¢ CC to specify the compiler executable
-
-  â¢ CPP to specify the C preprocessor executable
-
-  â¢ LD to specify the linker executable
-
-  â¢ CPPFLAGS to pass additional include paths or other preprocessor options
-
-  â¢ LDFLAGS to pass additional library paths or other linker options
-
-An example combining some of these would look like:
-
-   ./configure CC="/opt/intel/bin/icc" LD="/opt/intel/bin/xild" \

-The Xv video-out plugin fails to compile!
-
-If you want to have Xv support compiled in, make sure you either have a shared
-Xv library on your system, e.g. ls /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv* should give you some
-.so libs, like this:
-
-   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.a
-   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so
-   /usr/X11R6/lib/libXv.so.1
-
-Alternatively you need to have libtool 1.4 or newer installed, then libXv.a is
-sufficient. Otherwise you can create the shared versions yourself:
-
-   ld --whole-archive -shared -o libXv.so.1 libXv.a
-   ln -s libXv.so.1 libXv.so
-   ldconfig
-
-Now you should be ready to build the Xv video-out plugin on your system.

-
-As stated there (there again that hint *grin*), make sure that you have $prefix
-/bin in your path and that your linker is able to find libraries installed in
-$prefix/lib By the way, $prefix is where you installed your xine-lib to earlier

-Can I install xine in my home directory (without being root)?
-
-Sure. First set up a subdir where you install your private software, eg.
-
-   mkdir ~/xine
-
-Then you have to set a few environment variables - it's probably a good idea to
-add this to your ~/.bashrc (or somewhere similar):
-
-   export PATH="$HOME/xine/bin:$PATH"
-   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/xine/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

-Now you can unpack tarballs e.g. in ~/xine/src (mkdir ~/xine/src if necessary)
-and do a
-
-   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/xine
-   make install

-You also need to tell frontends using xine-lib, where to find it:
-
-   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/xine --with-xine-prefix=$HOME/xine

-Playback of various stream types
-
-DVD Playback with xine
-
-How do I play back DVDs with xine?
-
-Newer xine (1.0.x) releases come with a full-featured DVD plugin that should be
-able to handle any unencrypted, non-locked DVD with full menu navigation
-support. No external plugins are required anymore here.
-
-To get DVD playback working, first make sure you have a symlink /dev/dvd
-pointing to your DVD device on your system. For example, if your DVD drive is
-the master ide drive on the second IDE channel, /dev/dvd should point to /dev/
-hdc. Please note that if you are using the ide-scsi emulation on your system,
-it is likely that your DVD drive got mapped to a scsi device node even though
-it is an ide drive. In that case first check out you boot/kernel logs (or run
-cdrecord -scanbus) to find out which device it got mapped to and set the
-symlink accordingly (should be something like /dev/scd0, /dev/scd1, ... in that
-case). Also make sure you (as a user) have sufficient (read and write)
-permissions on your DVD drive. This could mean you either have to change the
-device permissions or add your user to a special group (e.g. addgroup cdrom
-username), depending on your setup and/or distribution.
-
-It is highly recommended to switch DMA mode on for your DVD drive (without it
-even very recent machines will have trouble producing smooth video output). Use
-a command like hdparm -d 1 <device> on your DVD device. Please note that even
-if you're using ide-scsi you will have to set the dma flag on the ide device
-node (e.g. /dev/hdc), not the mapped /dev/scd scsi device.
-
-To be able to play back encrypted DVDs you need to have libdvdcss installed on
-your system (please check if this is legal where you live). If you do not
-understand what the term "encrypted DVD" means here: As a rule of thumb, every
-DVD you have to pay money for is most likely encrypted.
-
-To make matters worse, apart from encryption, there is another obstacle to
-take: the region code. The DVD authorities decided to divide the world into
-eight geographical regions. Have a look at http://www.dvdforum.gr.jp/
-RegionMap.pdf if you want to know which number has been assigned to your
-country. It is now their idea, that you shall only play DVDs, which have been
-produced for your region. If you take a DVD off the shelf in your local store,
-you should find a little globe-like icon which shows the region code the disc
-is for.
-
-Newer (post-2000) DVD drives (so-called RPC-2 drives) check the DVD region,
-which means they'll prevent you from playing back DVDs that have a different
-region code from what the drive is set up for. Some drives come with a factory
-setting of region 0 so they can play back any DVD until a region code is set.
-Others refuse to play any DVD at all until they are told a region. The easiest
-way to handle this is to use the regionset utility from http://sourceforge.net/
-project/showfiles.php?group_id=31346&release_id=168415 .
-
-Once you have everything set up, try something like gxine dvd:/ or xine -p dvd:
-/ to start dvd playback. Some frontend also offer so-called autoplay buttons or
-menu entries that start dvd playback immediately.
-
-Important: do not try to mount the DVD. Just insert it and hit the DVD autoplay
-button or start xine from the command line.
-
-If things do not work as expected, try running the xine-check shellscript that
-comes with xine to see if this gives you further hints on what could be wrong.

-DVD playback works, but it takes a long time until playback starts
-
-This points to a region code problem. Some versions of libdvdcss can play back

-VideoCD troubleshooting guide
-
-This gives higher-level troubleshooting. More lower-level information is given
-in the next section.
-
-  â¢ When you open the configuration dialog of your frontend, you should see a
-    vcd config section. An important setting is default_device. If this is set
-    to the empty string, the VCD plugin will try to scan your drives for a
-    suitable device if the driver has the capability to scan for drives.
-    However you can set the device to something of your choosing. On GNU/Linux,
-    this may be /dev/cdrom and on Solaris it may be /vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0.
-
-    If you set this field, make sure these are correct for your particular
-    setup. For example, I generally play out of the DVD device and this is
-    called /dev/dvd rather than /dev/cdrom.
-
-  â¢ Your frontend should offer a VCD autoscan button or menu item. If you
-    select this, you should see your CD disk light go on if you have one. And
-    the CD should be read. You should get a playlist of what's on the VideoCD.
-
-    If not something's wrong, possibly you configured the wrong drive. You
-    might try to read a disk image of a VideoCD and thus elimate any problems
-    with hardware. You can get a test VideoCD disk image to test here: http://
-    www.vcdimager.org/pub/vcdimager/examples/test_svcd/test_svcd_pal.zip .
-    After unzipping this there should be files test_svcd_pal.cue and
-    test_svcd_pal.bin. Run xine with the MRL vcd:/test_svcd_pal.cue:E0. If you
-    see something playing then this is a hardware problem. You might also want
-    to try starting playback-control with vcd:/test_svcd_pal.cue:P1.
-
-  â¢ There should be at least one "track", and one "entry" listed for the
-    VideoCD and the names of these in the MRL list will end with "T1" and "E0"
-    respectively. Often there are other playlist items, and if you have menus
-    or still frames there will be "segments" as well. The simplest things to
-    check are probably "entries" and "tracks". If there are no entries listed
-    or none of the tracks or entries play, then there may be a problem with
-    that particular medium. So as in the step above, you can try a known good
-    sample and perhaps burn a CD from that. More likely if you get this far,
-    some of the items listed work and some do not. There are a number of
-    debugging switches that you can dynamically turn on and off that may be
-    able to help in isolating more specific problems. See the section below.
-
-  â¢ Something plays now, but you do not get any menus? Well, first is there
-    supposed to be a menu? In the last step you should have seen what is on the
-    VideoCD. Still frames are always "segments" so see if you can find one in
-    the MRL list and select that.
-
-    If there are no segments listed, there aren't any still-frame menus. It's
-    also possible to have menus in looping MPEG's. Use the vcddump tool to find
-    loops. vcddump is also part of VCDImager. Another program that can help you
-    examine the contents of a VideoCD is vcdxrip.
-
-    To troubleshoot, start out with the known SVCD example that has a
-    still-frame menu at the beginning: http://www.vcdimager.org/pub/vcdimager/
-    examples/test_svcd/test_svcd_pal.zip Inside this is a largish file called
-    test_svcd_pal.bin and another short text file called test_svcd_ntsc.cue.
-    These are CD disk images; that is, something that could be burned to a CD
-    drive such as with cdrdao. However you don't have to create a CD to view
-    these with the xine VCD plugin. You should be able to play the VideoCD by
-    running the MRL vcd:/test_svcd_pal.cue. If you see a still frame on
-    startup. Great! If instead you see what looks like the beginning of a movie
-    (Blue Streak with Martin Lawrence) then go to the next step.
-
-  â¢ You have a VideoCD with menu and can see it, but there is no menu on
-    startup? If you have the VideoCD from the last step, then run the MRL vcd:/
-    test_svcd_pal.cue:P1 If this shows a still frame, but it just does not show
-    when you hit either the "VCD" autoscan button or give a MRL without the P1
-    at the end then go to the next step.
-
-    If you have another VideoCD, from the MRL list, you should also see
-    "playlist" entries. Try selecting the one that ends "P1". If you don't see
-    an entry with P1, then your VideoCD does not have playback control (PBC)
-    and although there may be a still frame on the VideoCD it may have been
-    authored so it is not easily accessed. Again vcddump or vcdxrip can help
-    here.
-
-  â¢ You have a VideoCD with menu at beginning and can see it using an MRL with
-    P1 at the end, but you want to see it by hitting the "VCD" autoscan button
-    as well? Check to see that you have the configuration entry
-    media.vcd.autoplay set to playlist.

-Can I watch Quicktime (.mov, .mp4) files using xine?
-
-Quicktime is just a system layer (container format) which can contain various
-different audio and video formats. The system layer itself is fully supported
-in xine. However, some quicktime audio/video codecs are not natively supported
-yet. Luckily, if you are using a x86 compatible machine (any recent PC hardware
-should do) you can install and use the original Quicktime DLLs and watch most
-streams (trailers) that can be downloaded from the net.
-
-Possibly the most convenient way to get the Quicktime DLLs is to download them
-from the MPlayer website http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html . The
-package is called "essential". Unpack it and move everything you find inside to
-/usr/lib/codecs (actually you can place them anywhere you want, e.g. someplace
-in your home directory, but then you'll have to set
-decoder.external.win32_codecs_path in your xine config file accordingly).
-Restart xine then and you should be able to watch Quicktime trailers.

-with Quicktime Streams (see above). The newer real audio and video formats are
-only supported by using binary-only codecs which are not included in xine.
-
-Possibly the most convenient way to get the Real codecs is to download them
-from the MPlayer website http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html . The
-package is called "essential". Unpack it and move everything you find inside to
-/usr/lib/codecs and set the decoder.external.real_codecs_path in your xine
-config file to /usr/lib/codecs (actually you can place them anywhere you want,
-e.g. someplace in your home directory, but then you'll have to set
-decoder.external.real_codecs_path accordingly). Restart xine then and you
-should be able to watch Real files/streams.

-What about (live) network streams (pnm://, rtsp:// style urls)?
-
-xine supports both pnm and rtsp streaming. However, digging out the actual pnm/
-rtsp url can be tricky as they're often packed into heavy JavaScript and HTML
-code on most websites. You can either use a combination of your browser's "save
-source" function and wget or use a xine browser plugin (currently the gxine
-frontend comes with a simple mozilla plugin, for example). When you decided to
-dig out the url by hand don't get fooled by the many redirectors that are often
-placed around the actual url. Use wget to download any http://-style urls and
-use less to look inside the downloaded .ra/.ram files where you will find the
-actual pnm/rtsp url which can be opened using xine.

-install windows binary codecs (.DLLs).
-
-Possibly the most convenient way to get the Windows DLLs is to download them

-Running xine
-
-I have a lot of dropped frames - what can I do?
-
-Your hardware might be too slow for xine. Make sure you turn on all speed
-optimizing options. A few things you should check (in order of importance):
-
-  â¢ First of all, run the xine-check script included in xine package (probably
-    already installed in your system). xine-check will report several of the
-    most common problems listed here. Sample output from xine-check:
-
-       xine-check
-       Please be patient, this script may take a while to run...
-       [ good ] you're using Linux, doing specific tests
-       [ good ] looks like you have a /proc filesystem mounted.
-       [ good ] You seem to have a reasonable kernel version (2.4.18)
-       [ good ] intel compatible processor, checking MTRR support
-       [ good ] you have MTRR support and there are some ranges set.
-       [ good ] found the player at /usr/local/bin/xine
-       [ good ] /usr/local/bin/xine is in your PATH
-       [ good ] found /usr/local/bin/xine-config in your PATH
-       [ good ] plugin directory /usr/local/lib/xine/plugins exists.
-       [ good ] found input plugins
-       [ good ] found demux plugins
-       [ good ] found decoder plugins
-       [ good ] found video_out plugins
-       [ good ] found audio_out plugins
-       [ good ] skin directory /usr/local/share/xine/skins exists.
-       [ good ] found logo in /usr/local/share/xine/skins
-       [ good ] I even found some skins.
-       [ good ] /dev/cdrom points to /dev/hdc
-       [ good ] /dev/dvd points to /dev/hdc
-       [ good ] DMA is enabled for your DVD drive
-       [ good ] found xvinfo: X-Video Extension version 2.2
-       [ good ] your Xv extension supports YUV overlays (improves MPEG performance)
-       [ good ] your Xv extension supports packed YUV overlays
-       [ good ] Xv ports:  YUY2 YV12 I420 UYVY
-
-  â¢ Try to use the Xv driver, it greatly improves performance and quality
-    because your graphics card does image scaling and colourspace conversion.
-    The video section contains important information about several Xv drivers.
-
-    If Xv cannot be used for some reason, make sure your display is set up to
-    16bpp, not 24 or higher (reduces memory bandwith). Some Xv drivers may also
-    have better performance with 16bpp.
-
-  â¢ Make sure the hard drive (or cdrom/dvd drive) which supplies the video data
-    is in DMA mode (if supported).
-
-    On most linux-based systems, you can use hdparm to check this:
-
-       hdparm /dev/hda
-       [...]
-       using_dma    =  1 (on)
-       [...]
-
-    You can enable DMA mode with the following command:
-
-       hdparm -d1 device_of_your_drive_that_supplies_video_data
-
-    In some cases where this fails it helps to specify the dma mode to use, for
-    example:
-
-       hdparm -d1 -X 66 device_of_your_drive_that_supplies_video_data
-
-    In RedHat 8.0 an additional entry in /etc/modules.conf
-
-       options ide-cd dma=1
-
-    should help (reboot for this change to take effect).
-
-    More information about this may be found here: http://oreilly.linux.com/pub
-    /a/linux/2000/06/29/hdparm.html .
-
-  â¢ Use a recent kernel which is optimized for your hardware. Old kernels may
-    lack support for accelerated instructions like SSE, for example.
-
-  â¢ Close other applications (use a tool like "top" to find out what
-    applications are using up CPU power). Programs that update the system clock
-    like ntp should also be disabled.
-
-  â¢ Enable MTRR support in your kernel. If you are still using XFree 3.x,
-    you'll have to tell the kernel yourself where the graphics memory is.
-    You'll find details about that in the linux dvd howto.
-
-    If you're using X.org or XFree 4.x, enabling MTRR support in your kernel
-    should be enough (use a recent kernel!).
-
-    Try a cat /proc/mtrr - if the file exists and you find an entry
-    corresponding to the amount of graphics memory you have, everything should
-    be fine.
-
-  â¢ Have your X-server (usually X.org or XFree86) running with higher priority.
-    Most recent linux distributions (like RedHat 8.0 or Mandrake 9.0) should do
-    that for you, improving not only xine but desktop responsiveness in
-    general.
-
-    Use the "top" utility and verify under the "NI" column if the X process has
-    a negative value, this indicates a higher priority. See "The X Window User
-    HOWTO - Performance considerations" for further instructions http://
-    www.tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO/performance.html .
-
-  â¢ Use the latest or a known-good gcc version and build an optimized xine-lib
-    for your architecture.
-
-  â¢ Besides boosting X-server priority, sometimes it's possible to avoid
-    discarding frames by making xine itself higher priority. This is not a
-    recommended pratice since it will require to run xine as root, but you may
-    give it a try if you want:
-
-       nice --5 xine
-
-  â¢ xine needs high speed memory access which depends on your chip set. Make
-    sure you enable all speed-improving options.
-
-    Especially the via apollo pro chipset is known to be quite weird, (most of
-    all on my gigabyte board). If you can't configure the ram access thoroughly
-    using the bios you might want to try some really nasty tricks, as explained
-    on (for example): http://www.overclockers.com/tips105/index03.asp
-
-    This website centers around a windows-tool to tweak the chipset, you can do
-    the same on FreeBSD with pciconf. On some linux distributions there are
-    similar tools.
-
-  â¢ a nice performance tuning tool can be found here: http://
-    powertweak.sourceforge.net
-
-  â¢ Set up and use raw devices for DVD access. Please note that the actual
-    performance gain during playback is very small if any, but since raw
-    devices are bypassing the kernel's buffer cache, Linux will not try to
-    cache the DVDs you play. This would not be useful, because xine does its
-    own caching and you usually play DVDs sequentially, which means you won't
-    reuse anything from the cache. But the problem would be that Linux throws
-    everything out of the cache that might be in there.
-
-    Raw devices should be available in linux kernel 2.4.x and there are patches
-    for older kernels available from: ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
-    people/sct/raw-io/
-
-    To use raw devices, first connect a free raw device to your dvd device, use
-    something like:
-
-       raw /dev/raw1 /dev/dvd
-
-    Then create a link named "rdvd" pointing to that raw device:
-
-       ln -s raw1 /dev/rdvd
-
-  â¢ For slow / high-latency dvd drives it might help to increase the number of
-    video buffers xine allocates. Try setting
-    engine.buffers.video_num_buffers:500 to a higher value (e.g. 1000 or 2500).

-
-Oki, xine doesn't drop frames now but video output still is not really smooth!
-
-Video output can be further improved by tuning your linux kernel:
-
-  â¢ Set HZ to 1000 in /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386/param.h
-
-  â¢ Try applying scheduler patches, especially the O(1) and the preemptive

-When I'm watching a movie, the sound effects are much higher in volume than the
-voices!
-
-Congratulations, you seem to have an original movie audio track there.
-
-Uhm. So you don't like it. Well, there are two things you can do:
-
-  â¢ You can enable xine's audio compressor. Most frontends have a settings
-    window and in that you'll find a slider for the compressor setting. The
-    values are percent values, so a slider setting of 200 means that xine will
-    double the volume of silent parts of the movie (loud parts stay the same).
-
-    If your frontend does not have such a compression slider, you can pass the
-    value with the MRL:
-
-       xine dvd:/#compression:150
-
-  â¢ If you have a dolby digital (AC3) soundtrack, you can try to enable
-    liba52's dynamic range compression setting audio.a52.dynamic_range:1 in
-    your xine config file (or use some gui config dialog).

-
-If this problem only occurs with one specific stream, maybe switching to a

-strange channels.
-
-If all this doesn't help, maybe you're missing an audio codec or you found a

-Can xine produce 4-/5-channel surround audio output?
-
-Yep, it can do that using OSS or ALSA drivers, provided that the driver

-Retrieving the driver
-
-The OSS driver is maintained by creative and can be downloaded at http://
-opensource.creative.com/. The driver package contains documentation on how to
-install it. Besides that I'd like to add the following notes.
-
-In order to compile and install these drivers, you need a valid kernel
-configuration file. For RedHat Linux's pre-compiled kernels these configuration
-files can be found in /usr/src/linux/configs. After you've located the correct
-config file for your kernel, you need to copy it to /usr/src/linux/.config For
-example, when you run the 2.4.18-i686 kernel do :
-
-   cp /usr/src/linux/configs/kernel-2.4.18-i686.config /usr/src/linux/.config
-
-Make sure that the emu10k1 module that is currently installed is not loaded. To
-unload the modules:
-
-   /sbin/modprobe -rv emu10k1.o ac97_codec.o
-
-If this mentions that the device is busy, some program is using the driver.
-Some example could be a mixer application or sound daemon like artsd. You'll
-need to close down the applications before continuing. At success it should
-print something like:
-
-   # delete emu10k1
-   # delete ac97_codec
-   # delete soundcore
-
-Run make in the directory where you unpacked the driver and follow the
-instructions printed at the end of each step. The last step should be:
-
-   make install-tools
-
-As the README of the driver package mentions the SPDIF AC3 output doesn't work
-by default. In the directory utils/scripts an emu10k1.conf file can be found
-which need to be placed in the default installation directory (/usr/local/etc).
-After this the emu10k1.conf needs to be modified. The following settings worked
-fine for me (I don't use the analog outputs of the card):
-
-   CARD_IS_5_1=yes
-   USE_DIGITAL_OUTPUT=yes
-   ENABLE_TONE_CONTROL=yes
-   AC3PASSTHROUGH=yes
-   ENABLE_LIVEDRIVE_IR=no
-   INVERT_REAR=no
-   MULTICHANNEL=yes
-   ROUTE_ALL_TO_SUB=no
-   ANALOG_FRONT_BOOST=no
-   SURROUND=no
-   PROLOGIC=no
-   ENABLE_CD_Spdif=yes
-   ENABLE_OPTICAL_SPDIF=no
-   ENABLE_LINE2_MIC2=no
-   ENABLE_RCA_SPDIF=no
-   ENABLE_RCA_AUX=no
-
-After modifying the emu10k1.conf, you need to modify your /etc/modules.conf and
-make sure the following lines are in there.
-
-   alias sound-slot-0 emu10k1
-   post-install emu10k1 /usr/local/etc/emu-script
-
-After saving the changes to modules.conf, run
-
-   /sbin/depmod -a
-
-Now, you're ready to load the new modules and set the correct options for it.
-To load the modules run:
-
-   /sbin/modprobe emu10k1

-The cable used for the SBLive can easily be self-made or buy a stereo 3.5mm
-jack to dual RCA cable.
-
-What you need to make the cable yourself:
-
-  â¢ stereo 3.5mm jack plug
-
-  â¢ RCA plug
-
-  â¢ shielded cable (video coax 75 Ohm will do)
-
-Connect them as follows :
-
-   center pin jackplug ------|----- center pin RCA plug
-                   GND     __|__    GND
-
-In order to test it use a DVD with AC3 or DTS track start xine and select the
-right audio track from user interface or start xine as:
-
-   xine dvd:/1 -a 0
-
-The external decoder should display something like "Dolby Digital" in case the
-selected audio track contains AC3 data or "DTS" in case the selected audio
-track contains DTS data. Of course stereo audio also goes through the SPDIF
-output, so the analog outputs of the SBLive 5.1 are not needed anymore.

-Changing the volume with the GUI control has no effect! What's up!?
-
-Some xine drivers do not support volume changing although the GUI will show the
-volume bar. Usually this is not xine's fault: aRts C API, for example, doesn't
-offer any volume property to applications. Similarly, with ac3 pass through it
-is not possible to set the volume.
-
-Note that recently we added support to "simulate" volume in aRts by changing

-having access to sound card's mixer but at least users will not complain about
-lacking of volume bar anymore! :)

-Audio is stuttering and i see a lot of "metronom: fixing sound card drift by
--2115 pts" on the console output
-
-Might be a soundcard problem, if it only comes in longer intervals. Your
-soundcard does not keep it's sampling frequency accurately enough, which
-results in audio and video getting out of sync and xine has to compensate. If
-you see the message only from time to time, you might remedy it by using the
-resampling sync method. You can do this by setting the configuration entry
-audio.synchronization.av_sync_method to resample.
-
-If you receive the metronom message more often, maybe switching to different
-drivers (alsa to oss or vise-versa) can help here. It has also been reported
-that setting the configuration entry audio.synchronization.force_rate to the
-native sampling rate of your soundcard (try 44100 and 48000) helps sometimes.
-
-Another, whole different possibility is that you have some background process
-running which is messing with the clock (like some ntp client - chronny, ntpd,
-...).
-
-Occasional messages of "fixing sound card drift" may happen on start and when
-playing a long stream (like a movie). This is normal behaviour, nothing to
-worry about.

-
-xine seems to lose sound arbitrarily during playback, especially with DVDs
-
-You are using the OSS audio output plugin, right? In order to keep video and
-audio in sync, xine regularly queries the audio driver for the amount of delay
-induced by the current length of the driver's audio buffer. Unfortunately some
-OSS drivers seem to be broken because the can return strange values here. This
-confuses the xine audio subsystem and makes it drop audio.
-
-You should try the various settings of the configuration entry
-audio.oss_sync_method. The options getodelay and getoptr ask the driver and
-might therefore show the problem. But chances are that only one is broken and
-the other works, so you should try them both first, since they are the most
-accurate. The option probebuffer does not ask the driver directly but tries to
-determine the buffer length from outside. This should work with any driver and
-is the way to go, of the driver dependent methods fail. softsync is the least
-accurate and should be used only in emergency situations.

-
-The image looks strange, it is shifted, cropped or shows weird lines!
-
-This points to a problem with the Xv extension, which is used by xine to
-display the video image. To verify this, try running xine with the XShm video
-output plugin:
-
-   xine -V XShm
-
-If that works fine, you just proved, that the Xv extension is buggy. xine will
-remember the last used video output plugin, so the setting will stay at XShm.
-You could simply continue using this, but XShm is a lot slower than Xv, so read
-on and see if you can get it working. Usually you should look for updated
-versions of the X driver module that belongs to your graphics card.
-
-Other possibilites are limitations in either your X driver module or your
-graphics hardware. If your card could somehow be running out of ressources
-(graphics RAM perhaps) and displays an incorrect Xv overlay because of that,
-try reducing the display resolution and/or colour depth.

-How can I make xine use the Xv extension and what drivers do I need?
-
-xine will normally use Xv by default if it is available. In some cases you
-might need to choose Xv playback manually (when the ~/.xine/config file for
-some reason says that you want to use XShm):
-
-   xine -V Xv
-
-If this doesn't work for you, it may be possible that Xv is not present on your
-system.
-
-First you need to install/use X.org or XFree 4.x. Once you got that you have to
-make sure the X drivers you're using are supporting Xv on your hardware. Here
-are some hints for individual gfx chips:
-
-  â¢ 3Dfx: if all you get is a solid black window, upgrade to X.org or XFree
-    4.1.0 or later.
-
-  â¢ ATI: if you only get "half a picture", try lowering your resolution or bit
-    depth, disable DRI (looks like you ran out of video RAM)
-
-  â¢ Trident card: If you see vertical bands jumbled, upgrade to the latest
-    xfree/experimental trident drivers (for the CyberBlade XP a driver exists
-    here: http://www.xfree86.org/~alanh/ )
-
-  â¢ nVidia: With newer GeForce cards, Xv should work with XFree 4.2.0 or newer,
-    for older RivaTNT cards use the binary drivers from nvidia (of course the
-    binary drivers work as well for GeForce cards)
-
-  â¢ Mach64/Rage3D (not Rage128/Radeon) cards/chips get no XVideo with standard
-    drivers, try GATOS drivers instead
-
-  â¢ intel: i815 has Xv support in XFree 4.x, others unknown
-
-  â¢ Permedia 2/3 has Xv support in XFree 4.x
-
-  â¢ Savage: at least some older drivers tend to lock up the whole machine, try
-    the drivers available from http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html .
-
-  â¢ SIS: certain controllers (more info needed!) have Xv support in XFree 4.x
-
-  â¢ Chips and Tech 6555x, 68554, 69000, 69030 have Xv support in XFree 4.x
-
-  â¢ NeoMagic: certain controllers (more info needed!) have Xv support in Xfree
-    4.x
-
-  â¢ SiliconMotion: certain controllers (more info needed!) have Xv support in
-    Xfree 4.x

-The aspect ratio of the video is wrong!
-
-Usually xine discovers the screen aspect ratio by querying the X-server and
-then adjusts the video automatically to make it look right. However, if that
-doesn't work try pressing "a" to manually change the aspect ratio.
-
-If you have a wide screen monitor, make sure the X-server is correctly
-configured. The X-server must know the physical size of the screen, which is
-independent of the resolution being used.
-
-For X.org, the screen size should be set in the "Monitor" section in the file /
-etc/X11/xorg.conf, as in the example below:
-
-   Section "Monitor"
-      Identifier   "Monitor0"
-      VendorName   "Monitor Vendor"
-      ModelName    "DDC Probed Monitor - ViewSonic G773-2"
-      DisplaySize  320  240
-      HorizSync    30.0 - 70.0
-      VertRefresh  50.0 - 180.0
-   EndSection
-
-For XFree86, the filename is normally /etc/X11/XF86Config.
-
-Where DisplaySize specifies, in millimeters, the physical size of the monitor's
-picture area.

-What is the difference between discarded and skipped frames?
-
-Sometimes xine will output a message like that:
-
-   200 frames delivered, XX frames skipped, YY frames discarded
-
-The difference between these counters is a little subtle for the non developer.
-There are two threads running in order to display video: the decoder thread
-will deliver frames to the video output thread. The latter is responsible for
-scheduling the frames to be displayed at the right time.

-If your system can't keep up with decoding requirements, decoder will deliver
-overdue frames. Imagine if it finished decoding the frame tagged for displaying
-at 11:30 but xine clock marks 11:31. When this situation is detected, xine will
-try to skip decoding a few frames to recover. Not every decoder may support
-this feature.
-
-When the frame is decoded to be shown somewhere in future but the output thread
-doesn't get scheduled in time by the operating system to complete the
-operation, the frame is discarded. One cause might be the disk access
-operation, which may halt the system for a few miliseconds without DMA. See
-performance section tips above.
-
-Note that if a decoder can't skip frames for some reason, you would never see
-frames skipped (they would be all discarded).

-My xine is runing in black and white! / I only get a grey video output!
-
-This frequently happens with new Xv drivers or when switching to a different
-video card. Background is that different Xv drivers often use different ranges
-for the contrast/brightness/saturation settings.
-
-To fix this, try opening the xine settings window and try adjusting the sliders
-for contrast, brightness and saturation.
-
-Please note that some frontends save these settings in their config file so

-
-Which is the best video driver to use?
-
-xine supports several video drivers for outputing the image. These will differ
-on how the frames are copied to the video card memory, whether colourspace
-conversion and scaling is done in software or hardware, among other things.
-They may also differ on ease of use and stability.
-
-Most of the time, Xv should give the users a good trade-off between quality,
-compatibility and ease of use. This is why xine tries to use Xv by default.
-
-However some users may want to explore better the available hardware
-capabilities (eg. syncing frame drawing with monitor refresh). Also some Xv
-drivers contain slow copies and accessing the video card directly may yield
-performance gains.
-
-Drivers that access hardware directly includes VIDIX (warning: requires root
-priviledges or kernel helper) and SyncFB (requires kernel helper - Matrox
-only). User may try one of those, but should be warned that with root access
-they can cause the system to crash hard. The support is also limited to a
-couple of graphics cards only.
-
-Graphic workstations like SGI have usually a good support for OpenGL. In that
-case, using OpenGL may be a better choice than XShm. However for most desktop
-systems the performance of OpenGL will be quite bad.

-OSD and overlay related questions
-
-What is this "unscaled" OSD about?
-
-Since version 1-rc3 of xine-lib supports a new method for rendering OSD (On
-Screen Display) and subtitles. This method uses a X11 extension called XShape
-that allows using screen resolution instead of stream resolution. It is called
-"unscaled" OSD because it does not scales with the video being played.
-
-Suppose you are watching a 320x200 video in full screen. Normal OSD would be
-blended at 320x200 and then scaled to full screen (lets say, 1024x768),
-resulting in big and ugly fonts. The unscaled overlay is drawn directly to
-screen, creating a sharper and better looking OSD.
-
-There are side effects too. Sometimes the unscaled overlay show some glitch
-just before disappearing. Some people may be annoyed enough by that and might
-want to disable the usage of unscaled overlay altogether.
-
-Unscaled OSD usage by subtitles and xine-ui is controlled by the following
-settings (~/.xine/config or ~/.gxine/config):
-
-   gui.osd_use_unscaled:0
-
-   subtitles.separate.use_unscaled_osd:0

-
-I can't see the OSD or it leaves a black box over the image!
-
-If you are using xine-lib version 1-rc3 or newer, this is probably due buggy XV
-drivers that do not support unscaled OSD (the XShape extension) properly.
-
-There have being reports of some ATI drivers that don't allow displaying
-anything over the video. The VIA Epia binary drivers is reported to leave a
-black box where the OSD was displayed.
-
-The problem may be fixed by either updating the video driver, or disabling xine
-unscaled OSD support.

-
-Why colours of overlays/subtitles seem to be "leaking"?
-
-xine blends most overlays, specially the ones from DVD discs, directly over the
-image (scaled OSD). Unfortunately most codecs (like MPEG2) use a subsampled
-image format (YV12) that makes properly blending an interesting challenge.
-
-In short, this is a known xine bug. There have being discussions on improving
-the blending quality but, so far, nobody implemented a better (scaled) overlay
-renderer. Contact developers if you want to try doing something about it.

-
-Why subtitles can't be displayed outside the video?
-
-It is possible, but older xine versions may not support it. There are two
-alternatives for rendering the subtitles outside the video image:
-
-  â¢ Use the "expand" post plugin to increase frame height adding black bars to
-    it. This will allow blending the subtitles over the black bars, since they
-    will be part of the video now.
-
-  â¢ Use unscaled OSD, as it does not requires any video to render the subtitles
-    on.
-
-Also notice that DVD overlays (including subtitles) are meant to be displayed
-in a fixed position, this is how the DVD menu highlighting works. xine does not
-support moving them.

-
-What kinds of subtitle fonts does xine use?
-
-xine can use two kinds of fonts:
-
-  â¢ TTF fonts
-
-    If xine is compiled with freetype library xine recognizes and uses TTF
-    fonts directly.
-
-  â¢ xine fonts
-
-    This is xine's native format. It's better because the font generator
-    utility implements more features than the "on the fly" TTF renderer.
-
-The font for text subtitles is selected via config option
-subtitles.separate.font. You can specify xine font name (sans, serif, ...) or
-file name of the TTF font. The directories $prefix/share/xine/libxine1/fonts
-and ~/.xine/fonts are searched for the fonts, with $prefix being the place
-xine-lib was installed to. Usually this is /usr/local or /usr. TTF fonts are
-also searched for in the current directory.

-
-How to create own xine subtitle fonts?
-
-xine's native subtitle fonts can be generated from TTF fonts with the utility
-xine-fontconv. It isn't compiled and installed by default but you can make it
-manually. You'll need freetype and zlib packages together with their versions
-for development plus a compiler, of course ;) Here's how you build
-xine-fontconv:
-
-  â¢ Get the source of xine-fontconv utility from the misc directory within the
-    xine-lib sources.
-
-  â¢ Compile it:
-
-       gcc xine-fontconv.c -o xine-fontconv `freetype-config --cflags --libs` -lz
-
-
-You'll need some TTF font for generating. Characters in this font should cover
-all codepages you want supported, otherwise you'll have missing characters.
-
-Syntax is:
-
-   ./xine-fontconf font.ttf font_name [encoding1 [encoding2 [...]]]
-
-For example default font sans was generated with following command:
-
-   ./xine-fontconv Aril_Bold.ttf sans iso-8859-1 iso-8859-2 iso-8859-5 \
-                                      iso-8859-9 iso-8859-15 cp1250 cp1251
-
-There are displayed messages about missing characters on the screen during
-generating. It's OK if the missing characters are U+007f..U+009F. These
-characters come from iso-8859-1 and they aren't displayable.

-
-Encoding of external subtitles is bad. What is wrong?
-
-The encoding of the external subtitles is expected to be iso-8859-1 by default.
-You need to set an appropriate encoding in the config option
-subtitles.separate.src_encoding. Note that you also need a font which contains
-all characters from the given encoding.
-
-The default font sans and fonts serif and mono cover these encodings:
-
-  â¢ iso-8859-1
-
-  â¢ iso-8859-2
-
-  â¢ iso-8859-5
-
-  â¢ iso-8859-9
-
-  â¢ iso-8859-15
-
-  â¢ windows-1250

-If that works fine, you just proved, that the Xv extension is buggy. xine will

-"audio driver 'oss' failed, using null driver instead"
-
-First of all, make sure that your OSS Audio drivers are working (i.e. you can
-play music with other software). Maybe you're using alsa? If so, try gxine -A
-alsa to see if this helps.
-
-The most common reason for oss not working is that some other program is
-accesing your audio device. If you're using linux, the command fuser /dev/dsp
-should give you the PID of the process.
-
-If you are using GNOME, chances are that this is caused by ESD. Now you have
-two possibilities. Either deactivate ESD (temporarily) by right clicking on the
-sound monitor applet and selecting "Place Esound in standby" or just kill it.
-Then xine will use OSS audio output. The other method is to make xine use ESD
-for audio output with:
-
-   gxine -A esd
-
-This may result in worse playback - exact syncronization is not possible with
-esd, so using oss should be preferred.
-
-If you are using KDE, there is the possibility that the aRts sound daemon is
-currently running and thus blocking your sound device. You can check that by
-starting the aRts control (in your KDE menu it should be under Multimedia). If
-it is running, you can either use the aRts audio output plugin:
-
-   gxine -A arts
-
-Or you suspend the aRts daemon by checking the appropriate option in your aRts
-control. (recommended)
-
-Newer versions of arts have an auto-suspend mode - this can lead to some
-nondeterministic behaviour of xine if it is set up to use the audio device
-directly. Using arts is recommended in that case; however, you will lose the

-xine just crashed on me - i didn't get any error message
-
-OK, yes, that shouldn't happen and you're upset. We can understand that. But,
-to help you and of course to fix this, we need some information. So, let's go
-through the checklist and maybe prepare a nice bug report for the xine-user
-mailing list:
-
-  â¢ Did xine really crash (segfault) or did it hang (deadlock)?
-
-  â¢ Can you reproduce the bug? (e.g. do you remember what you did and when you
-    do it again it crashes again?)
-
-  â¢ Is that a specific media file or format which crashes xine? (Have you tried
-    other files types?)
-
-  â¢ Check the console output (and include it in a bug report), maybe earlier
-    there is some output that points to the problem.
-
-  â¢ Your X server just froze on you? unfortunately that's a known problem with
-    some chipsets and drivers (most commonly Savage chipsets) when using Xv.
-    You might want to try running gxine -V XShm to see if the problem is
-    related to the Xv driver. This will unfortunately be much slower, as lots
-    of things are now done in software instead of hardware scaling/colour space
-    conversion.
-
-    Maybe at the time you read this, there's an X upgrade which fixes this for
-    the Savage driver. If that works for you, please notify the xine crew at <
-    xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net>, so they can update this FAQ!
-
-  â¢ Even though we try to make each release as bug free as possible, xine is
-    still under heavy development (nice excuse, isn't it? *grin*).
-
-    If you write to the xine user mailing list <xine-user@lists.sourceforge.net
-    > make sure you include a the above information (when applicable) and also
-    some information about your machine (operating system, cpu type and speed,
-    gfx card, sound card, ...) and please use a meaningfull subject line ("xine
-    bug" is bad, "xine fails to play this quicktime trailer in fullscreen mode"
-    ist much better).
-
-    Thanks for taking the time to help improve xine.

+A step-by-step guide to xine releases
+=====================================
+
+Siggi Langauf, 2003-12-17
+
+This guide provides a simple "recipe-like" guide to making releases. While
+only strictly covering releases of the "xine-lib" module, the procedure is
+almost the same for all the other modules. You only have to substitute the
+module name, and probably make other tests. ;-)
+
+Okay, so let's describe your starting point:
+You're going to be the release manager. The last release has been a long
+time ago. By now, many important bug fixes have accumulated in CVS while
+users (who are not aware of any mailing list besides xine-announce) are
+wondering if xine is still a maintained project. However, everybody's
+committing wildly to CVS, preferrably redesigning the core xine engine and
+often forgetting to make notes about their work in the ChangeLog.
+
+Currently, best practice to get a release out looks like this:
+
+1) announce the upcoming release on xine-devel! Ask developers:
+   - if they think CVS is ready for a release
+   - if there are any important known bugs
+   - to double-check and update the ChangeLog
+
+2) make pre-release checks (many of these should be already done, but now is
+   the time to go through the whole checklist:
+   - does it build? (probably best: check nightly build logs)
+     note: test at least on an ia32 machine _and_ any big endian box
+   - does it run?
+     (again: play a simple file on at least intel+any BE platform using the
+      new library)
+   - is it feature-complete?
+     Ideally, you'd test all demuxers, decoders and post plugins, along with
+     all audio and video drivers. As this is totally unrealistic, you'll
+     have to restrict yourself to a practical subset. This should include
+     the [standard test parcours] (see below)
+     note: We're going to collect all features in a strategical overview and
+           identify at least one dedicatet tester for each feature.
+           So check that overview! Ask testers to test if their feature is
+           marked "untested".
+   - you might want to run "make release-check", it will tell you about files
+     from CVS missing in the release; be sure to check these
+
+       AND
+
+     you might want to run "make distcheck", this will test the
+     packaging, building, and testing of all xine-lib. This will
+     alert you to any missing files from the tarball or problems
+     in the Makefile rules.
+
+   - does "make dist" produce a complete (ie. compilable) tarball
+     (note: nightly build logs will tell you this.)
+
+3) Versioning
+
+   You should already know by now, from which branch of CVS the release is
+   going to be made. The current scheme is to have a stable branch from
+   which the subminor releases like 1.0.1, 1.0.2,... are made and an
+   unstable branch in CVS head, which is going to become the next minor
+   (1.1) or major (2.0) xine-lib version.
+   
+   Make sure you know
+   - what the new release should be called
+     (the "marketing version" part of the tarball name, for example)
+   - if any _internal_ structures (like xine_t) have changed
+   - if any _external_ interfaces (include/xine.h) have been added or changed
+
+   Then check our 3 version systems:
+   If any internal structures have changed, you may have to increase some
+   (or all) of the plugin IFACE_VERSIONs. In that case, you might want to
+   ask for help, so this doesn't take the whole day...
+   Then, edit configure.ac:
+   - set XINE_MAJOR, XINE_MINOR, XINE_SUB according to the marketing version
+   - set the XINE_LT_* constants according to the comments. DO _NOT_ mess with
+     these! If you're not sure about changed/added interfaces diff
+     include/xine.h against the previous release and/or ask!
+
+4) cvs commit your changes, and update CVS. Double-check CVS logs. Be sure
+   people have stopped comitting wildly. If they haven't: mail to xine-devel
+   and waitl till the dust settles!
+
+5) make a candidate tarball:
+   make maintainer-clean; rm .cvsversion; ./autogen.sh; make dist
+   (this is the time to make some tea, or better some strong coffee ;)
+
+6) check the candidate tarball:
+   - does it have the right name?
+   - does it unpack, compile and install correctly?
+     note: make sure to build with as many features as possible
+           on a Debian box, "apt-get build-dep xine-lib" and 
+           "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot" are a good way to do that
+   - test the candidate (and make sure you are running exactly the new
+     version!) This should at least cover the [standard test parcours]
+   
+   If you find any errors: fix them (get help on xine-devel or #xine)
+   and go back to step 4)
+
+The tests have now all passed. you've got the release tarball in your
+hands.
+
+7) Tag the release: cvs tag -R xine-1_2_3-release
+   (this would be the tag for xine-lib-1.2.3, for example)
+
+8) upload the tarball to ftp://upload.sf.net/incoming
+   note: you can start the upload while CVS is tagging
+
+9) Write release notes: Read through the ChangeLog, try to look at any
+   changes from a "what would users note" perspective:
+   - How would you classify the release (bugfixes, new features, ...)?
+   - Has anything visibly changed from previous releases?
+   - Are there any pitfalls/tricks for this upgrade?
+   - Which are the most obvious improvements?
+   Include the output of "md5sum xine-lib-1.2.3.tar.gz" in the release notes
+   and "gpg --clearsign" them.
+
+10) Click your way through the file release system on http://sf.net!
+    Copy&Paste both the (signed!) release notes and ChangeLog in there.
+    Make sure to check the "keep my preformatted text" box
+
+11) write the announcement for xine-announce:
+    You start with the release notes from step 9, without the signature, but
+    including the MD5 sum. rewrite it to look like an email announcing the
+    release. Copy&paste all ChangeLog entries for this release into the
+    announcement. Make sure you have GPG clearsigned the announcement when
+    sending it!
+    (also make sure it gets immediately approved by the xine-announce
+     moderator!)
+
+12) write the announcement for xinehq:
+    You need to login on xinehq and use your admin privileges to create a
+    news article in the "New Releases" section. Include a link to the
+    SourceForge Release notes/Changelog page and one to the download page.
+
+    Warning: triple-check that you get the HTML correct! If you have
+             unmatched quotes, you might break the whole website so that it
+             can only be repaired by manually fiddling with mysql to get the
+             HTML right!
+
+13) write the Freshmeat announcement:
+    use your freshmeat account to log into their website, if you aren't
+    permanently logged in, anyway.
+    go to the xine project, click "add new release" and work your way
+    through. This announcement must be a bit more terse version of what you
+    wrote in step 9). And it should make people interested in the release.
+
+That's it. Finally.
+At this point, you have probably earned your sleep ;-)
+
+
+
+The [standard test parcours]
+----------------------------
+
+There are a few things that simply _must_ work. So take a few minutes to
+test at least:
+- an MPEG1 video file
+- a DivX AVI file (with AAC sound,
+                   alternatively test _any_ file with AAC sound in addition)
+- a DVD (test menu navigation, button highlighting, subtitles
+         and video playback)
+- a VCD (preferrably with menu)
+- an MP3 file, with goom visualization (does Ctrl+i overlay correct info?)
+- a QuickTime or mp4 file
+
+For all those files, check:
+- if audio/video are in sync
+- video looks good
+- audio sounds correct
+- there is no visible jitter or stuttering
+- try to seek a bit (more, yes, stress it!)
+
+If you find any anomalies: mail to xine-devel immediately! If you're lucky,
+somebody will fix it before you're throught with the rest of your release
+preparations. Asking on #xine may also help.
