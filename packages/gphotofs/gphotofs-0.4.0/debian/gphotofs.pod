=head1 NAME

gphotofs - filesystem to mount digital cameras

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GPhotoFS is a filesystem client based on libgphoto2 that exposes 
supported cameras as filesystems; while some cameras implement the
USB Mass Storage class and already appear as filesystems (making
this program redundant), many use the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP)
or some other custom protocol. But as long as the camera is supported
by libgphoto2, it can be mounted as a filesystem using this program.

As libgphoto2 is a userspace library for interacting with cameras,
it is natural that if one to build a filesystem ontop of it, one
should use FUSE, and that is what I have done.
