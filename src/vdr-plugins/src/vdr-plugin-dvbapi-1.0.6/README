NOTE TO NEW LINUX USERS: All lines that are prefixed with the '$'
character are commands that need to be typed into a terminal window /

You will have to grab the source code of course. First install the git
package provided by your distribution. Then from a terminal, type:

   $ git clone git://github.com/manio/vdr-plugin-dvbapi.git

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Basic Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For sample installation instructions refer to INSTALL file.
For Kathrein UFS 9xx support refer to extra/sh4-ufs9xx/README file.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. OScam compatibility
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are building newest oscam from sources, then just use newest plugin
git revision. The following table explain details.

OScam version        dvbapi plugin version
svn rev >= 7314      1.0.3 or recent git versions
svn rev < 7314       1.0.2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Plugin setup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The log level parameter of the plugin can be configured either from VDR
menu or manually editing the VDR's setup.conf file (remember to change
the file when VDR is not running).

The parameter line for the plugin is:
dvbapi.LogLevel = 2

The values for the log level are:
  0 - totally disable debug
  1 - only error messages
  2 - information and error messages (default)
  3 - all information including debug


The size of DeCSA TS buffer can also be changed using this config line:
dvbapi.DeCsaTsBuffSize = 4
The default is 4 MB which should be sufficient, but if you have overflow
errors in the log and/or the output stream has errors, you can try to adjust
this value experimentally.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Commandline options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some budget card drivers provide a CA device (eg: /dev/dvb/adapter0/ca0).
This leads the plugin to detect the card as a full-featured one, thus
disabling software CSA. You should use commandline option -B to force
detection as a budget card in such a case.

If you want to enable budget mode on adapter 0 and 1 you need to run vdr
like this:
  vdr -P"dvbapi -B0 -B1"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Known problems
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The plugin may conflict with dynamite plugin. You need to disable dynamite
plugin in case of problems.
