				<?% gettext('<p>Here you can edit an automatic timer\'s (AutoTimer) settings.</p>
				<p>AutoTimer is a key feature of VDRAdmin-AM. An AutoTimer consists of one or more search terms and some other settings, that are looked for regularly in the Electronic Program Guide (EPG). On match AutoTimer adds a timer in VDR automatically for that broadcast. That\'s very comfortable for irregularly broadcasted series or movies you don\'t want to miss.</p>') %?>

You can set multiple search items by separating them with spaces. Broadcasts will match only if they match <strong>all</strong> configured search items.<br />You\'d better only use letters and numbers for search items, as the EPG often miss colons, brackets and other characters.<br />Experts can also use regular expressions, but you have to get needed information from the VDRAdmin-AM sources (undocumented feature).<br /><br />You can exclude broadcasts so that they don\'t get recorded even if they would match an AutoTimer. Therefore you have to enter that titles into the file <i>vdradmind.bl</i>, one event a line. This file must be located in your VDRAdmin-AM\'s configuration folder. If this string is found either in the EPG\'s <u>title</u> or in <u>title~subtitle</u>, this event will not be programmed by AutoTimer. So you can disable complete episodes (for example when using "Enterprise" as blacklist string) or only one episode (when using "Enterprise~Azati Prime" as blacklist string).') %?></dd>
