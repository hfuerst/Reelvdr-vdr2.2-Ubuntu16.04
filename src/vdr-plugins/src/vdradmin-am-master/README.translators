VDRAdmin-AM translators guide
==============================

Since vdradmin-0.97-am3.2 almost every text has been extracted from the
scripts and templates. This makes it much easier for anybody, who wants to
translate VDRAdmin-AM to another language.

All you need to do is to let me (mail AT andreas DOT vdr-developer DOT org)
know, that you plan to add a new language, so that I can tell you if anybody
else is already working on that language. After my OK you can start your work.

-----

We've decided to use GNU gettext for translating the user interface to
different languages. GNU gettext is widely used among Linux programs of all
kind. It comes with a lot of tools and with support for most programming
languages.

The translations are stored in plain text files with a *.po file extension.
Each language has its own file (e.g. de.po, fi.po, ...). You may edit these
po-files with any text editor, but we recommend to use a po-editor like
poedit [1], kbabel [2] or gtranslator [3].

You must have installed the "gettext" package of your distribution to compile
the plain text translations to the binary files needed by VDRAdmin-AM.

The basic work flow for a translation looks like this:

1) Copy po/vdradmin.pot to po/<language code>.po. See [4] for a list of
   available language codes.
   
2) Open the file in your favorite po-editor. Make sure you set the correct
   encoding and fill in your email and language in the corresponding header
   fields. poedit makes this pretty easy - just go to catalog/options and
   fill out the form.
   
3) Now you can start translating. Keep in mind, that if you translate a message,
   you should use html entities [5], [6] for special characters. Any text that
   origins from vdradmind[.pl] must not have html entities.
   Beside the help texts, you will not need any formating tags.
   
   Messages marked as "fuzzy" indicate, that they may have been derived from
   similar messages and it's not sure, that the translation is correct. Check
   these translations and correct them if needed or simply mark them as not
   fuzzy (poedit: edit/mark as fuzzy)
   
4) To check how your translated texts look like, you have to compile them
   first to *.mo-files. To do so, you edit "make.sh" first and append
   your  <language code> to the "LANGS=" line. Running "./make.sh po" will then
	 create a new *.mo-file from your changed *.po-file.
   
   Please note, that you have to restart vdradmind[.pl] after any changes you 
   make to the translation. In order to allow VDRAdmin-AM to select your language,
   you must have the appropriate locales installed on your system (see 
   "locale -a"). You should make sure, that the correct locale is selected
   with the LANG and LC_* environment variables.

	 For example: LANG=de_DE ./vdradmind
   
5) If you are done, send the *.po-file to me:

   mail AT andreas DOT vdr-developer DOT org
   
6) When changes have been made to VDRAdmin-AM, that cause some messages to
   change, the *.po-files will by modified and we will send them to the
   translators. The process then starts with 2) again and we will include your 
   new translation with the next release.


If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
